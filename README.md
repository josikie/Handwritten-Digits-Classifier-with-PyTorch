## Handwritten Digits Classifier with PyTorch

In this project, I trained a model with PyTorch to classify handwritten digits. The dataset is MNIST dataset, The MNIST database is a large database of handwritten digits that is commonly used for training various image processing systems. 

From the testing proccess, I got testing accuracy: 98.20% and testing loss: 0.10939. So, the model does not overfit or underfit.

I built it to passed the second submission of AWS Machine Learning Fundamentals on Udacity.
