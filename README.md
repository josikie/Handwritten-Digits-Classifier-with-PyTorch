## Handwritten Digits Classifier with PyTorch

In this project, I trained a model with PyTorch to classify handwritten digits. The dataset is MNIST dataset, The MNIST database is a large database of handwritten digits that is commonly used for training various image processing systems. From the testing dataset, I got testing accuracy: 98.20% and testing loss: 0.10939
I built it to passed the second submission of AWS Machine Learning Fundamentals on Udacity.
