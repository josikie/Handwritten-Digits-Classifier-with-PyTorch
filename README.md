## Handwritten Digits Classifier with PyTorch

In this project, I trained a model with PyTorch to classify handwritten digits. The data it used is MNIST dataset, The MNIST database is a large database of handwritten digits that is commonly used for training various image processing systems. 
I built it to passed the second submission of AWS Machine Learning Fundamentals on Udacity.
